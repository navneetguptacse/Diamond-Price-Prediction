# Diamond Price Prediction

This web application allows users to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes and quality factors. It provides accurate price estimations by leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and a comprehensive dataset of diamond characteristics.

## Features

- Predict the price of diamonds based on carat, depth, table, dimensions, cut, color, and clarity.
- Utilizes a trained machine learning model to provide accurate price estimations.
- User-friendly interface for entering diamond attributes and obtaining predictions.
- Real-time results displayed instantly after submitting the form.

## Installation
